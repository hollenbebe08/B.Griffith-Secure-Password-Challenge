# Generating a Secure Password

## Steps to complete:
* When I click the button to generate a password I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
* When prompted for a password criteria I am able to select which criteria to include in the password
* When prompted for the length of the password I am able to choose a password that has a length of 8 - 128 characters
* When asked for character types to include in the password I am able to confirm if I'd like to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
* When I answer each prompt my input is validated and at least one charater type is selected
* When all prompts are answered a secure password is generated for me that matches the selected criteria
* When the password is generated it is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
